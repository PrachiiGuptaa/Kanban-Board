# KANBAN BOARD

# **Description**

Kanban boards are a visual way to manage work. They help teams visualize their work, identify bottlenecks, and continuously improve their processes.

Kanban boards are made up of columns, each of which represents a stage in the workflow. For example, a Kanban board for software development might have columns for "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".

Each work item is represented by a card that is placed on the board. As the work item moves through the workflow, the card is moved from column to column. This allows the team to see at a glance which tasks are in progress, which tasks are waiting, and which tasks have been completed.
